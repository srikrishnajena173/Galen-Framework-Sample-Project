# Galen-Framework-Sample-Project :
Since the evolution of responsive websites, it has been a challenge in testing services to test the website layout on various devices, various screens size and different browsers. Just assume if you have to test the UI of a website in Mobile, Tablet, and PC, you will need to repeat the set of test cases thrice for each device. Again the efforts increase when you need to check for different browsers. Such a tiring job it would be. How to automate testing for layout and how to make sure about the responsiveness? As a solution to this, we have Galen Framework.<br>
<br>
Galen Framework is an open sourced automation testing framework to test the look and feel of your responsive website.
